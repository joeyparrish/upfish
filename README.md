## Logo

The UpFish logo is based on two free vector graphics from
[Vecteezy](https://vecteezy.com/):
 - "Linear Fish Icons": https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/157657-linear-fish-icons
 - "Arrow Icon" https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/553925-arrow-icon


## Why is it called "UpFish"?

I wanted to name the project after something from "Wizard People, Dear Readers".
It turned out that the name "Viacom" was already taken, and the name
"Necrobenimbloalaphasagoso" was almost too long to tweet.
