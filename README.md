## What is UpFish?

UpFish is a Chrome extension that allows you to modify the audio of your
streaming movies.  It was designed to bring the DVD-era magic of
"[Wizard People, Dear Reader][]" back to life on the streaming site of your
choice.  (But I didn't stop there.)


## What can UpFish do?

Out of the box, UpFish can:

  - Turn "[Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone][]" into
    "[Wizard People, Dear Reader][]", in which Harry and friends swear and
    drink a lot

    [(preview 2)](https://youtu.be/MvW-Qh8VW4M)
  - Turn "[Vertigo][]" into "Fartigo", in which Jimmy Stewart farts a lot
    [(preview)](https://youtu.be/WqjrHzIr4VQ)
  - Karaoke any music video (remove vocals from the center)

If you can write a little JSON, you can make UpFish do other things, too!

## Why is it called "UpFish"?

I wanted to name it after something from "Wizard People",
but "Viacom" was already taken,
and "Necrobenimbloalaphasagoso" was almost too long to tweet.


## Customization

You can create and publish your own configurations, and adapt movies any way
you want.  You can:

 - Independently control the volume of each audio channel
 - Choose between or mix karaoke-filtered and original audio
 - Choose different processing for stereo and surround sound
 - Add extra audio tracks to be synchronized with the movie
 - Control the volume and mixing of everything
 - Adjust volume and mixing dynamically over time

For details on customization, see documentation on the config file format in
[docs/config.md](https://github.com/joeyparrish/upfish/blob/main/docs/config.md#readme).


## Analytics & privacy

Before version 1.0.3, we tracked the number of installations and the number of
sessions over time, but this was removed.  The code for it can still be found
in the repo history if you are curious.
